# Virtual Desktop Assistant - Friday
 This is a Virtual Desktop Assistant named Friday, developed in python for performing some basic daily tasks on command. I developed this while learning some new python modules.
 This is just the beginning as The Project is in BETA Phase, many more features will be added on in the future :)
